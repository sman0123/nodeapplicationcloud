The goal of this automation guide is to create a set of scripts, so that when you want to deploy a new version of your application, you only have to git commit & push your changes and run the script.

We will create two scripts:

The deploy/remote.sh script is run on the remote server. It performs all the steps that you would do manually on the server, such as running git pull, running npm install, restarting Passenger, etc.
The deploy/local.sh script is run locally. It performs all the steps that you would do manually on your local computer, such as running as SSH'ing into the server.

To make the script work, chmod 755, both the files and, upload the remote script to the deployment server
and run the localscript in the local build server
